# Xipper

Xipper (_'ch'ipper_) is a streaming text cypher designed to provide symmetrical key encryption for
short text entries in a manner that remains compatible with the original formatting
and usage. That is, it's not readable, but looks readable and acts like written
language.

This project is derived from work done by Scrambls back in 2010. The concept was
originally used to encrypt tweets, posts and emails, end-to-end, with no special
requirements on the application or transport host.

It has been modified to function for tokenization of web requests and attribute
data.
